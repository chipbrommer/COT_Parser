CoT Utility v0.2.0. 

This project was originally created to parse XML CoT messages being received from an external source into my C++11 and legacy C applications under the name COT_Parser.

Since, I have decided to expand upon my initial creation to transition this into more of a full CoT utility that will parse and generate XML CoT messages.

This project has a good base and I would like to expand more on it if outside users have needs / requests for addition support of desired fields. 

Examples:
Please see the 'examples.cpp' for a list of use case scenarios I have created.
